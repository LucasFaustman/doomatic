## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
Tech used: CSS, React

This was my first time utilizing Local Storage in order to store unique to do's for each user. I also learned how to use Redux in order to utilize global state so users can see the total number of completed to do's in the reports page.

## Optimizations

- I originally had a due date tab, but decided it would be not as useful without added features. I'm hoping to build out the app more so users can search, filter, and sort by due date.

- Perhaps add a notes section where users can click into a to do to get more of a description of a specific to do.

- A built out reports section where users can see their completed to do's per month.

- A monthly goal section

## Lessons Learned:

Through this project, I was able to practice more with React concepts, such as:

- Using the effect hook to utilize local storage

- State

- Conditional Rendering

- Forms

- Redux

- Router Dom

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
